## Overview
This project introduces a Field Service AI Assistant designed specifically for frontline maintenance technicians in the power industry. The system supports mobile deployment on rugged devices, optimized for harsh on-site environments where typing or multitasking is difficult.
### Use Case Scenario:
When a transformer fault alarm is triggered in a remote substation, the technician must quickly prepare and travel to the location. This assistant provides intelligent, real-time support throughout the entire repair workflow — from preparation to reporting.  
case：  
Morgan is a field technician responsible for maintaining remote electrical substations. When a critical system failure occurs, Morgan receives only a vague error message: “XXX Plant ERROR / Warning.” With little information and no clear guidance, Morgan is forced to head to the site unprepared. Upon arrival, he quickly realizes he lacks the necessary tools, spare parts, or support to resolve the issue. The troubleshooting process is slow and uncertain — he spends days wondering: “Is it broken? Should I check B or replace C?” With no access to real-time diagnostics or historical maintenance data, Morgan is left frustrated, alone, and inefficient.
