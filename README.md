## Overview
This project introduces a Field Service AI Assistant designed specifically for frontline maintenance technicians in the power industry. The system supports mobile deployment on rugged devices, optimized for harsh on-site environments where typing or multitasking is difficult.
# Use Case Scenario:
When a transformer fault alarm is triggered in a remote substation, the technician must quickly prepare and travel to the location. This assistant provides intelligent, real-time support throughout the entire repair workflow â€” from preparation to reporting.
